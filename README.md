- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Prakash Mallick,
- I am passionate about research topics related to linear and non-linear control theory, system identification, supervised learning, deep reinforcement learning, stochastic optimal control, probabilistic inference, dynamics of robots, Algorithms, data structures.

Previously, I worked as a Quantitative Engineer/Researcher in the Research team of Ardea Investment Management. While I was working at Ardea, my responsibilities included but were not limited to collaborating with academics, economists, portfolio managers and other research analysts to deliver market leading analysis for our clients. I utilised my statistical and machine learning research and computing expertise to create valuable business tools and utilise the state-of-the-art-optimisation models, complex data structures and performant machine learning algorithms to deliver solutions to client requests.

Before/While joining Ardea, I graduated Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Newcastle, Australia in 2022. During my Ph.D. I focussed on the intersection of optimal control theory and machine learning (especially reinforcement learning) applied to unknown dynamical systems (mostly into robotic applications). The research I carried out was related to estimating parameters of control signals when the system has measurement noise which leads to optimal policy with a reduced uncertainty and better learning when embedded in a model-based reinforcement learning framework.

Before my Ph.D. studies I did my Masters of Engineering in Mechatronics from University of Melbourne in 2017 where I was introduced to the world of applied maths and operations research which made me pursue the Ph.D. in optimisation and machine learning.

Prior to that I was working as an electrical excavation engineer at India's biggest coal mining company, i.e., Coal India Limited from 2012-2015, immediately after graduating from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela as an electrical engineer, where I was involved with collating mine data, reporting, documenting, the work profile of complex electrical machineries and also with the supervision of heavy engineering equipment in open cast coal mine. I was also involved with near term forecasts of breakdown of electrical machinery and protective circuits.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working at AIML (Australian Institute of Machine Learning) researching on universal domain adaptation and trying to develop novel machine learning techniques for signal processing.
