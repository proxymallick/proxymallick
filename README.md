# Prakash Mallick's GitHub Profile

## Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m Prakash Mallick, a researcher with a passion for topics related to control theory, machine learning, robotics, and data structures.

## Work Experience

- Quantitative Engineer/Researcher at Ardea Investment Management 
  - Collaborated with academics, economists, portfolio managers and other research analysts to deliver market leading analysis for clients. 
  - Utilised statistical and machine learning research and computing expertise to create valuable business tools.
  - Applied state-of-the-art-optimisation models, complex data structures and performant machine learning algorithms to deliver solutions to client requests.

- Currently a researcher at AIML (Australian Institute of Machine Learning) 
  - Focusing on universal domain adaptation and trying to develop novel machine learning techniques for signal processing.

## Education

- Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from University of Newcastle, Australia in 2022
  - Research focused on optimal control theory and machine learning applied to unknown dynamical systems, mainly in robotic applications.
  - Worked on estimating parameters of control signals when the system has measurement noise to achieve optimal policy with reduced uncertainty and better learning when embedded in a model-based reinforcement learning framework.
- Masters of Engineering in Mechatronics from University of Melbourne in 2017
  - Introduced to the world of applied maths and operations research which led me to pursue a Ph.D. in optimisation and machine learning.
- Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela in 2012
